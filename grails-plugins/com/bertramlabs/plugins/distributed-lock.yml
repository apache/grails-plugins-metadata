  This plugin provides a framework and interface for a synchronization mechanism distributed to multiple server instances.  In today's world of horizontal computational
  scale and massive concurrency, it becomes increasingly difficult to synchronize operations outside the context of a single computational space (server/process).  This plugin aims to make that
  easier by providing a simple service to facilitate this, as well as defining an interface for adding low level providers.
