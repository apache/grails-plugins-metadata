  This is a simple, by convention, suggestion service to provide suggestions to auto complete controls.
  Just point the auto complete JS URL at suggest/[subject]?term=bla and you get a JSON list of suggestion strings back.
  You can add suggestion handlers to the service as a closure, or just add a text file named [subject].txt with an itemper line to be searched for matches. The simple search returns a result if an item string contains the term anywhere.
  See docs for details.
